## ⚠️ FFmpeg Warning

> 💡 **If you see an FFmpeg error saying it failed to download—don’t worry!**  
> `ffmpeg.exe` is already bundled inside the `YouTube Downloader.exe`.  
> Just check the folder you selected; your downloaded files will be there.

## 🛠️ Optional: Add FFmpeg to System PATH (Recommended)

To improve compatibility and performance, you can add FFmpeg to your system PATH:

1. Download FFmpeg from: [https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
2. Select: `ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z`
3. Extract the folder anywhere (e.g., `D:\Apps\ffmpeg\`).
4. Open the extracted folder and go to the `bin` directory. Example:  

C:\Program Files (x86)\ffmpeg-<date>-git-<version>-essentials_build\bin

5. Copy that path.
6. Add it to your **System PATH** environment variable.

### 🤔 How to Edit the System PATH?

If you're unsure how to do this, you can search for:

> **“Edit the system environment variables”** in the Windows Start Menu,  
> then click **Environment Variables** and edit the `Path`.

I'm done for now 😅
